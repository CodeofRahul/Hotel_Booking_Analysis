# Hotel_Booking_Analysis

## Business Problem
In recent years, City hotel and Resort hotel have seen high cancellation rates and as a result each 
hotel is now dealing with a number of issues, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel 
room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotel’s primary goal in order to 
increase their efficiency in generating revenue and for us to offer thorough business advice to 
address this problem.

## Assumptions

1. No unusual incident happen between 2015 and 2017.
2. The information is still current and can be used to analyze a hotel's possible plans in an efficient 
    manner.
3. The hotels are not currently using any of the suggested solutions.
4. The biggest reason for reduced income generation is booking cancellation.

## Research Question

1. What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How can we reduce the number of hotel reservation cancellations?
3. How can hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

## Hypothesis

1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2. When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.
3. The majority of clients are coming from online to make their reservations.

## Analysis and Findings

The bar graph shows the Count of Reservations that are cancelled and that those are not. The “not 
cancelled” bar is taller than the “cancelled” bar, indicating that there are more reservations that 
were not cancelled than those that were cancelled. There are still approximately 36.44% of client 
who cancelled their reservation, which has a significant impact on the hotel’s earnings.

In this bar graph we can see that In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more 
bookings. It’s possible that resort hotels are expensive in those cities than others.

The line chart shows the average daily rate in city and resort hotels from July 2015 to July 2017. 
The highest average daily rate for both city and resort hotels occurred in July 2017.

I have developed the grouped bar chart to analyze highest and lowest level of reservation status 
by month. As we can see , the highest confirmed reservation in August and lowest cancellation 
in September. Whereas January is the month with the most cancelled reservation.

This bar graph confirmed that cancellations are more common when price are higher and least 
common when price are lower. Therefore , the cost of accommodation is solely responsible for 
the cancellation.

The pie chart shows the top 10 countries with reservations cancelation. Portugal has the highest 
number of cancellations, with approximately 70.28% of all reservations being cancelled.
